# springboot.sql.security.maven.onlineshop
This is learning project for online-shop.
In this project I used next stack:
1) Java 8
2) Spring Boot
3) Spring Security
4) Spring MVC
5) Spring DJPA - MySql Driver
6) Sun mail

It has such models as
1) User
2) Role
4) Product
5) Product basket
6) Order
7) Validatoin code

Authorization done from existing users in DB.
Different roles gives different accessibility. For example: customer can only do shoping
To submit your order you recive on your email validation code and then input it in the form
